     <p>Racism in the fashion industry is a continual topic that appears too often nowadays. Whether it is cultural appropriation or insensitive imagery towards another race, racist pieces still emerge despite all the backlash against them. On the other hand, there is also a concern about society taking certain messages way out of proportion. Are we starting to become too drastic in our opinions? <a href="article.html"><font color="#d4af37">Read More</font></a></p>

      <p>On February 12, 2017, singer/songwriter Joy Villa attended The 59th Grammy Awards wearing a gown with the Pro-Trump motto “Make America Great Again” embellished across the front. On the backside, President Donald Trump’s last name was printed along the bottom. A surge of backlash appeared on all social media platforms in response to Villa’s political message and her controversial label as a “Feminist” on her Twitter bio. <a href="arts.html"><font color="#d4af37">Read More</font></a></p>

      <p>Tragic events impact our history by leaving impressions of the trauma and devastation that can occur within the world. Some of these incidences fall under the concept of, “History should never be repeated.” Fashion consists of recycling ideas from past decades, such as oversized denim jackets from the ‘80s and the ‘60s/’70s bohemian style. However, there are times in which fashion fails by reviving a certain look that should never return. <a href="arts.html"><font color="#d4af37">Read More</font></a></p>
